# Time-Series-Project
Objective: To forecast Canadian Bankruptcy rate using Time series analysis.
The models are composed and validated for the period from January 1987 to December 2010. Composed models are then used to forecast bankruptcy rate in the years of 2011-2012 .
We also incorporated other macroeconomic trends, which can be good predictors of bankruptcy rate in our model including Unemployment Rate, Population, Housing Price Index
